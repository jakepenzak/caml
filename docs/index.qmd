## Welcome!

#### CaML = **Ca**usal **M**achine **L**earning


The origins of CaML are rooted in a desire to develop a set of helper tools to abstract and streamline techniques & best pratices in Causal ML/Econometrics for estimating ATEs, GATEs, and CATEs, along with policy prescription.   

As we began working on these helper tools, we begun to see the value in reformulating this framework into a reusable package for wider use amongst the community and to provide an opinionated framework that can be integrated into productionalized systems, particularly experimentation platforms, for efficient estimation of causal parameters for reporting & decision-making purposes.

Admittedly, we were half tempted to include the term "Auto" in the name of this package (e.g., AutoCATE, AutoCausal, etc.), but we quickly realized the potential for misapplication & naive usage that could arise from that type of "branding." Indeed, the misapplication of many Causal AI/ML techniques is all too commonplace in the data science community. **All of the standard assumptions for causal inference still apply in order for these tools & techniques to provide unbiased inference.**

At its core, CaML is an *opinionated* framework for performing Causal ML to estimate ATEs, GATEs, and CATEs, and to provide mechanisms to utilize these models for out of sample prediction & policy prescription. Given the initial intent is to provide a tool for productionalized systems, we are building this package with interoperability and extensibility as core values - a key motivation for using [Ibis](https://ibis-project.org/) to ensure we are backend agnostic for end users. 

The codebase is comprised primarily of extensions & abstractions over top of [EconML](https://github.com/py-why/EconML) & [DoubelML](https://docs.doubleml.org/stable/api/generated/doubleml.datasets.make_confounded_irm_data.html#doubleml.datasets.make_confounded_irm_data) with techniques motivated heavily by [Causal ML Book](https://causalml-book.org/) and additional research.
