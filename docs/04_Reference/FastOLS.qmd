# FastOLS { #caml.FastOLS }

FastOLS(
    self,
    Y,
    T,

FastOLS is a fast implementation of the Least Squares estimator designed specifically with Causal Inference in mind.

**FastOLS is experimental and may change significantly in future versions.**

This estimator estimates a standard linear regression model for any number of continuous or binary outcomes and a single binary treatment,
and provides estimates for the Average Treatment Effects (ATEs) and Group Average Treatment Effects (GATEs) out of the box. Additionally,
methods are provided for estimating a specific Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE), as well as individual Conditional Average Treatment
Effects (CATEs) for a group of observations.

This class leverages JAX for fast numerical computations, which can be installed using `pip install caml[jax]`, defaulting to NumPy if JAX is not
available. For GPU acceleration, install JAX with GPU support using `pip install caml[jax-gpu]`.

For outcome/treatment support, see [matrix](support_matrix.qmd).
