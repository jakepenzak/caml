We utilize [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for testing our codebase.

## Unit Testing
Unit tests are under the `tests/caml/` directory following the same structure of the `caml/` prefixed by "test_".
For example, if we wanted to write tests for `cate.py`, we would create a new file to build these tests
`tests/caml/core/test_cate.py`.

To run unit tests, simply run `pytest` in terminal:

This will run your unit tests (with respective output printed in terminal).

Additionally, an html report of the coverage will be exported to `tests/reports/htmlcov`,
which can be a useful tool for interactively evaluating the coverage of your unit tests.

## Advanced Testing
Unit tests are automatically run during PR process via GitHub Actions. Integration & regression testing forthcoming.
